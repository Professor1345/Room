## Overview

### HTML

The HTML code (`index.html`) serves as the foundation for the Room Website, defining the structure and content. Key sections include:

- **First Box**: Features a responsive navigation bar, logo, and a compelling message for an immersive user experience.
- **Second Box**: Introduces users to the furniture collection with captivating visuals and a call-to-action button.
- **Third Box**: Highlights information about the furniture, including its multifunctional nature and the availability of product specialists.

### CSS

The CSS code (`styles.css`) enhances the visual appeal of the website, providing styling and responsiveness. Highlights include:

- **First Box Styling**: Applies background images, text styles, and responsive layouts to the first box.
- **Second Box Styling**: Defines flex layouts, image styles, and responsive padding for the second box components.
- **Third Box Styling**: Styles the about-furniture section with appropriate fonts and spacing.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript code (`code.js`) adds interactivity to the website, focusing on mobile navigation and slide transitions. Key features include:

- **Mobile Navigation**: Implements functions (`openButton` and `closeButton`) for smooth toggling of the mobile navigation.
- **Slide Transitions**: Dynamically changes the background image and content of the first box based on user interaction.

## Challenges

Developing the Room Website presented several challenges:

- **First Box**: Overcoming hover issues and ensuring height responsiveness.
- **Second Box**: Resolving challenges related to overlay placement, flexbox calculations, and hover effects.
- **Third Box**: Addressing miscalculations in flexbox usage and resolving minor hover issues.
